<br><br><img alt="Iroda(Regioned)-min.png" src="-images/iroda(regioned)-min.png"><br><br>Set in the High Fantasy Medieval continent of Iroda...<br>For as long as anyone can remember, the world has been under the steady hand of the gods, with Ronos reigning as the King of the Cosmos. His influence is woven into everyday life – freedom of will and personal ambition are celebrated as divine virtues, shaping societies that value independence, exploration, and self-determination above all else.<br>Civilisation has thrived for centuries under this divine order. Great cities flourish, trade flows through bustling merchant guilds, and The Boundless Concord ensures the ideals of freedom remain protected. Stability and peace have endured for generations, with no great wars or upheavals in living memory.<br>The common folk live with a sense of freedom and stability, trusting that the world they’ve inherited will continue unchanged. Yet, beneath the surface, the winds of uncertainty have begun to stir.<br><br><br>
<br>The Boundless Concord<br>
The most prominent faction in all of Iroda: usually referred to as just "The Concord", these are the devout followers of Ronos, but is more than just a religious faction - it’s a movement. Its followers believe that true freedom comes not only from external liberty but from inner clarity and the courage to defy destiny itself. They view Ronos not just as a distant god-king but as a symbol of personal empowerment and the relentless pursuit of one’s own path.<br>
The concord works closely with the governments in all major cities to ensure the people of Iroda remain "free". With large armies and lots of resources into knowledge and the arts. They are the faction of the people.
<br>The Gilded Ledger
<br><br>In common knowledge, the magic in the world is described using the metaphor of an endless ocean. Casters have found varying ways to tap into the magic, named Virilis. Some being born with it running through their veins, others engineering "taps" to access and expend it. Learned casters (wizards, bards, druids etc) are highly respected as good at their trade, natural casters (sorcerers, innate etc) are perceived as lucky individuals, feared by some, respected by others. Warlocks are looked down upon as unworthy and unnatural by other casters. Magic is not rare, but not common, with<br><br>
<br>The Ancient Gods:<br>
There are stories of an ancient pantheon of gods whose names have been passed down through childhood stories and schooling (like the Ancient Greek Gods are to us). Some prominent names include: Edra of fate, Nidona of death, Ithar of the sea, Seraphina of magic. Some say they guided the world with wisdom, while others claim they meddled too much in the affairs of mortals, binding them to an unseen order. In time, their influence waned and their temples crumbled. No one knows if they were destroyed, left of their own will, or simply faded into legend. Now, only scattered ruins and half-remembered stories hint at the gods who once were, their purpose and power long forgotten.
<br>The Curse of the Ninth Onion:<br>
It is said that if a farmer harvests the very last vegetable in a patch, misfortune will follow for nine days. To avoid this, farmers always leave a single crop behind, ensuring that the field is never truly empty. Over time, this tradition became so ingrained that even in abandoned or overgrown fields, one can often spot a lone vegetable left behind - for luck, for respect, or simply for fear of tempting fate.
<br>The Seven:<br>
Legend tells of Seven Brothers, imbued with divine power to take down a malevolent God. But ambition corrupted some, and the brothers turned on each other in a tragic battle. The purest of them, strengthened by the Liberator’s gift, banished the corrupted kin to a shadowed realm and watched over cities for centuries after, rumoured to be protecting something.
<br>The Star That Fell Sideways:<br>
A shooting star once fell not from the sky, but sideways across the horizon, cutting through the world like a blade. Villages near the fall reported strange visions and heard whispers of a realm not meant for mortals. Folklore says that if you stand on the highest peak during a meteor shower, you might hear that same whisper – though none can agree on what it says. Some believe it promises fortune, others fear it’s a warning from something ancient and patient.
<br>The Feast of the Endless King:<br>
In forgotten times, a mighty king hosted a banquet so lavish that it never ended. Food replenished itself, goblets refilled unbidden, and guests danced forever in eternal revelry. But soon, they discovered they could no longer leave. The palace faded from mortal sight, and traveler's claim that, on misty nights, you can hear faint music from the hills. It’s said that if one stumbles upon the Endless King’s feast, they must leave before the third song ends – or risk joining the revellers forever.
<br>The Creation of the Goblinoids:<br>
Long ago, three warriors were sculpted by the gods, each meant to embody strength, cunning, and leadership. But before they were granted true wisdom, a trickster spirit whispered false knowledge into their unfinished minds, and they rose too soon. The first became a brute who relied only on strength, the second a sly scavenger who thrived on trickery, and the third a warlord who thought himself wise but lacked true foresight. Cast out and abandoned, they spread across the land - one a lurking predator, one a scheming thief, and one a commander doomed to overconfidence and failure.
